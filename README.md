## What is Coingulate?

Coingulate is more than just a word—it's a **mindset**, a **movement**, and a **memecoin** for hustlers, builders, and connectors who make things happen.

When you coingulate, you're not waiting for opportunities—you're creating them. You're reaching out to collaborators, leveraging your network, and using every tool at your disposal to turn ideas into reality.

## Etymology Breakdown

```
co-  +  ing  +  ulate
 │       │       │
 ↓       ↓       ↓
together  action  actively do/manage
```

**Together + Action + Actively Do = Coingulate**

To actively work with others, using connections & resources to **get it done!**

## Usage Examples

> *"I'm going to coingulate on this project—reach out to some collaborators and make it happen."*

## The Movement

Coingulate represents a new way of working and building:

1. **Collaboration over isolation** — Work with others, not alone
2. **Action over planning** — Execute, don't just strategize
3. **Resourcefulness over waiting** — Use what you have, pull every string
4. **Network over credentials** — It's not just what you know, it's who you know

## Who's Coingulating?

Builders. Founders. Creators. Connectors. People who ship. People who hustle. People who make things happen.
